# Task ID: Web Scraper

## About

A simple web scraper made to scrape blogs. This website take an URL as an input and displays the extracted data from that URL. An express server was made using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/). A node package called [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro) was used to request data from a URL and [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) was used to scrape that data. [EJS](https://ejs.co/#docs) was used to create templates to render the website with dynamic data. [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) was used to make the website responsive by using their [Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/).
